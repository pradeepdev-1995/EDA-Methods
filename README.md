# Exploratory Data Analysis

In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task

## Techniques for performing EDA

Some of the most common methods for performing the exploratory data analysis are given below. Definitely there are lots of another methods also  

A - Univariate and bivariate analysis  
B - Missing value analysis  
C - Outlier detection analysis  
D - Percentile based outlier removal  
E - Correlation analysis  
F - Covariance analysis  

This is one example result after the exploratory data analysis on a sample dataset

## Proposed methods

Here I am discussing mainly four advanced python libraries for performing the exploratory data analysis. They are  

1 - pandas-profiling  
2 - streamlit  
3 - sweetviz  
4 - wordcloud
